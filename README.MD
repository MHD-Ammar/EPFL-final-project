Project Review
Once you finished your project, please note that it is required that you submit it through the 
platform. You will find a button to do so at the very last page of the subject. After that, we 
will get in touch with you to book your final one-to-one meeting with us. Note that we will 
also check if you have completed all the exercises throughout the course according to their 
requirements, so make sure they are available on GitHub.
Important: Please note that we will need approximately 14 days to review your app submission and the 
appointment date must fall within your subscription period.
Please make sure that:
1. Your app fulfills all requirements.
2. All of the tasks from the checklist below have been completed. This includes the 
exercises.
3. All content (e.g., code and comments) in your project submission is either written by 
yourself or, where this is not the case, you clearly highlight the extent of the copied 
content and provide a reference to its source.
4. Your final project submission contains only files that are relevant for the project (i.e., 
no "test" files or non-project-related files).
5. Your final project includes a README.md (see details below).
Important: All exercises must be pushed to the respective repositories and work as per requirements. Please 
make sure of this before submitting the project. Otherwise, projects cannot be accepted, which might delay 
the review process. Also, note that once submitted, your project canâ€™t be updated anymore and the submitted 
version will be considered for review. So make sure you submit the project only when you have finished it.
Create a project README
Every coding project should have a companion file that describes what the project does, 
how it works, and how to get started. Typically this file is called README.md and by 
convention it is written in Markdown (.md). You can open Markdown documents with any 
text editor, e.g., VSCode.
To get started, create a file in your project directory called README.md. Copy and paste the 
text below into this file, editing the text to make sense for your project. Feel free to use 
markdown syntax to format your document.
Under the "Project Checklist" section: mark each completed task with an x (e.g., - [x] 
It is available on GitHub.) and fill in the file names/line numbers where 
required. Push this text file together with your code for the final project to GitHub. The 
project checklist contains the same points as mentioned in the project requirements in unit 
"What you'll need to build". For more details and specifications to the points, please refer to 
those project requirements.
# MY FINAL PROJECT 
A one or two sentence description of your project here. 
- What does it do?   
  Example: "This is a web project which tracks my music 
collection." 
- What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that 
we haven't seen before?   
  Example: "Chart drawing library graphs the user data" 
## Prerequisites 
Did you add any additional modules that someone needs to 
install (for instance anything in Python that you `pip 
install-ed`)?  
List those here (if any). 
## Project Checklist 
- [] It is available on GitHub. 
- [] It uses the Flask web framework. 
- [] It uses at least one module from the Python Standard 
Library other than the random module. 
  Please provide the name of the module you are using in your 
app. 
  - Module name: 
- [] It contains at least one class written by you that has 
both properties and methods. It uses `__init__()` to let the 
class initialize the object's attributes (note that  
`__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes 
instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. 
Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of 
at least one example of a class definition in your code as 
well as the names of two properties and two methods. 
  - File name for the class definition: 
  - Line number(s) for the class definition: 
  - Name of two properties: 
  - Name of two methods:  
  - File name and line numbers where the methods are used:  
- [] It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the 
localStorage of the web browser. 
- [] It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const 
rather than var). 
- [] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file 
feature. 
- [] It contains conditional statements. Please provide below   
one example of a conditional statement in your code. 
  - File name: 
  - Line number(s): 
- [] It contains loops. Please provide below the file name 
and the line number(s) of at least 
  one example of a loop in your code. 
  - File name: 
  - Line number(s): 
- [] It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some 
point. 
  This value is received and processed by your back end 
Python code. 
- [] It doesn't generate any error message even if the user 
enters a wrong input. 
- [] It is styled using your own CSS. 
- [] The code follows the code and style conventions as 
introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments 
and doesn't contain unused or experimental code.  
  In particular, the code should not use `print()` or 
`console.log()` for any information the app user should see. 
Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the 
browser.   
- [] All exercises have been completed as per the 
requirements and pushed to the respective GitHub repository
